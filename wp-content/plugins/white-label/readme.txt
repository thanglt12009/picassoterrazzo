Our White Label WordPress plugin lets you make a custom login, custom dashboard, custom admin, and much more.

== Description ==

White Label WordPress lets administrators change the WordPress branding to bring client's websites to life! You can add a custom logo, custom login, create a complete custom WordPress dashboard with your own widget, and other features to help clients use WordPress.

## Custom Login
Make your client's experience better when you use White Label to rebrand the WordPress login page. Our plugin lets web developers and agencies make a custom login page for their clients to use every time they use WordPress.

Modify the login page look by adjusting its layout, color scheme, background image, and even add a custom logo. Your custom login can match every element of your client's brand and identity.

## Custom Dashboard
Tidy up the WordPress dashboard to make life easier and less confusing for non-technical users. Your clients don't need to read or access most of the default information available on the WordPress dashboard. You can use White Label to make your own custom dashboard experience.

Create a custom welcome panel to replace the default one provided by WordPress. Remove dashboard widgets or create your own custom widget with whatever content you want clients to see. Want to replace the entire WordPress dashboard? You can with White Label. Create your very own custom dashboard right inside of the plugin for all other users to see when they log in.

## Custom Admin
White Label lets you configure parts of the WordPress admin so your clients only see what you want them to see. The custom admin features of White Label let you hide entire sections of the menu. Control exactly which menu options other users can see when they are logged in. Use White Label to also hide individual plugins so that your clients can't accidentally delete or update plugins without your knowledge.

In addition to those features, White Label offers more admin customization options. Set an admin color scheme and apply it to all users when they log in. Make text changes to the WordPress admin's menu bar and footer. You can even add custom Javascript right into the WordPress admin; perfect for integrating live chat widgets and other ways to communicate with clients.
